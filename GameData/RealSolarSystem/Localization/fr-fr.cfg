        // The genders of celestial bodies that do not have articles (that is,
        // all but « le Soleil », « la Terre », and « la Lune ») are somewhat
        // unclear.  From the gender of their namesakes, it appears to drift
        // towards that of their category, with the planets in particular
        // becoming feminine.
        // The situation is messier still for moons (do they bear the gender of
        // their namesake, that of moon, that of satellite?) and minor planets
        // (the options are the namesake, dwarf planet, or asteroid).
        // We use feminine for planets and dwarf planets.
        // We use masculine for satellites, with the exception of the moons of
        // Jupiter, which are more often referred to as moons.
        // Asteroids that are not dwarf planets would be masculine (but RSS has
        // none by default).

        // The bodies with articles should really be Soleil^m, Terre^f, and
        // Lune^f, with the articles added by the caller using <<A:1>> if
        // needed, so that phrases such as « système Terre-Lune » can be
        // expressed.  Unfortunately the stock strings were written without
        // the requisite As, so they require the articles.  Mods that wish to do
        // more advanced grammar will need to strip them and lowercase the
        // gender.
